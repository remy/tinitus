Notched Therapy for Tinnitus
============================

I'm a long time sufferer of tinnitus - even as I write this it rings away in my head. I found [research](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2918775/pdf/cib0303_0274.pdf) performed in the last few years that tells of a study performed with tinnitus sufferers and "notched music therapy". 

Often the sites that would help create notched music required some payment (that I personally didn't find was justified). Notched music can also be created using Audacity, but I knew with the new WebAudio API it could be done in the browser. So this is my attempt.

In lieu of a demo site, checkout the [5minfork](http://5minfork.com/remy/tinnitus/) of this repo (make sure to navigate to public directory).

*More details to come as I continue to develop this.*
